# Scene

In below pages introduce the implementation details about the auto-placement and auto-schedule of animations.

- The [Color map](31-color-map.md) assigns color to element units automatically.
- The [Placement](32-placement.md) places the register units, function units and memory units on the scene automatically.
- The [Animation flow](33-animation-flow.md) and the [Reference counter](34-refer-count.md) introduce how to schedule the animation flow.
