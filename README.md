# Welcome to Manim for ISA

This project aims to create a well-using framework to generate animations presenting the function 
of one instruction or an instruction sequence.

The whole project is based on `Manim <https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/index.html>`_, which is 
a very powerful Python-based animation framework for mathematics and algorithms. Meanwhile, it is 
very simple to use. Manim has been widely used in education and research.
