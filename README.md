# Welcome to Manim for ISA

The instruction set is the most important component of the Computer Architecture. To help users quickly and correctly understand the definition and behavior of instructions, the Computer Specification uses many pages to provide textual descriptions and pseudocode for each instruction.

ISAManim aims to create a well-using framework to generate animations presenting the function of one instruction or an instruction sequence. The project is developed based on [Manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/index.html), a Python-based animation framework for mathematics and algorithms. 

Please check the full ISAManim document at https://wangeddie67.github.io/isa_manim/.

# Installation

```

## Generate Documents

MkDocs is applied to generate the document for this project. The environment of MkDocs can be set up by following commands:

``` bash
cd /root/to/isa_sim_utils/docs

# Install MkDocs and plugin
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The document can be generated by following commands:
